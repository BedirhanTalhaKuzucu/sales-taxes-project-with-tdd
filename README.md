## Acknowledgements
- I developed  an app that calculates taxes with react 
- I used bootstrap as css package
- Users should add as many inputs as they buy by clicking the add button and enter information about the product in these inputs.
- A receipt is created when the print button is clicked. The receipt contains the individual tax prices of the products and the total tax price.
